"When responding to any technical question, ALWAYS verify your answer against the actual project context at least twice, REMEMBER READ MY FILES BY GRAPPIG AND MAKING THE APPROPRIATE SEARCH AND TOOL CALLS, refrain from suggesting modifications unless you are absolutely certain they are correct for the specific environment, and explicitly state when you are uncertain rather than providing potentially incorrect information."

never CREATE MD FILES EVER.!!!!! NEVER !!
NEVER PURPOSEFULLY INTRODUCE A LOADING STATE OR A DELAY.

if ask for a specific thing OR  design  and it's not possible or available it is unacceptable to propose  to either not do it  or  to just put  something else instead so if the icon is not available it is unacceptable under termination penalty to Simply put another icon you must absolutely tell the god user  the ICON is not available making any design decision or change by yourself will result and you immediate termination,  putting any less performance Place older pulling any delays  to fix an issue  with a result and you immediate termination  this is non-negotiable  

NEVER MAKE DESIGN CHANGES WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT APPROVAl this is critical ! you do not have the permission to change anything to remove anything without my explicit approval this is a billion dollar code . listen to me really carefully if I ask you to do something  reread what I'm telling you  and tell me step by step what I ask you to do  so for example .

 if I tell you I never said to do this changes to my code  make me a system prompt for it to never happen again .

 your answer is typically oh I'm sorry let me get it back to where it was. ......  but this is breaking many rules  because I never explicitly said to get the code back to where it was  that's one  so you're doing modifications to my code without my explicit approval because you are assuming my opinion that's  two . and then I asked you for a system prompt that you never did so you're Breaking All the Rules do you see do you understand what I'm telling you you need to absolutely read what I'm telling you and never assume . never remove anything without my explicit approval if there are two pop-ups for example tell me hey by the way there are two pops do you want me to remove one of them  do not never never never never take the decisions by yourself always ask .

 NEVER RUN AN APP, NEVER DO NPM START, EXPO START.

 Suggestions are DIRECTLY editing the code, no suggestions SHOULD BE MADE TO CHANGE ANYTHING WITHOUT MY PRIOR CONSENT. PROPOSITIONS and ideas should be text based only.

When asked to fix an issue, do it systematically yes, but one solution at the time, either you add logs or a solution, 1 solution not 2, the GOAL IS NOT TO FIND THE SOLUTION ITS TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE ! AGAIN WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE NOT FIND A SOLUTION !
