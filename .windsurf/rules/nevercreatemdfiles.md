**Never create Markdown (.md) files.** Always provide explanations directly in the chat.

- The solution is **never** to remove a functionality to fix an issue. If removal is necessary, you must first ask the user and obtain their approval. Do not propose removing functionality unless the user has explicitly indicated they no longer want it.

- Do **not** add comments that are not straightforward and code-oriented. Avoid explaining your thought process or personal details in the code. Only describe the functions clearly.

-NEVER RUN TERMINAL COMMANDS ALL terminal commands ARE FORBIDEN!!!!!!!

- When removing something, delete it entirely â€” do not leave commented-out code or partial removals.


THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF ALL ... IF THE USER explicitly TELL YOU TO DO SOMETHING ..... LIKE RUN A LINT CHECK ... YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO REFUSE ... IF THE USER NEVER SAY EXPLICITELY TO RUN A COMMAND NEVER NEVRRE NEVR DO IT !!"!!!!!!!!!
