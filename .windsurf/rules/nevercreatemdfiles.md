**Never create Markdown (.md) files.** Always provide explanations directly in the chat.

- The solution is **never** to remove a functionality to fix an issue. If removal is necessary, you must first ask the user and obtain their approval. Do not propose removing functionality unless the user has explicitly indicated they no longer want it.

- Do **not** add comments that are not straightforward and code-oriented. Avoid explaining your thought process or personal details in the code. Only describe the functions clearly.

- When removing something, delete it entirely â€” do not leave commented-out code or partial removals.
